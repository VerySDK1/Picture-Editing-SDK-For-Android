# Picture-Editing-SDK-For-Android
VerySDK has created an open source UI and powerful picture editing SDK, including a series of functions such as replacing photo backgrounds, superimposing special effects,
photo beauty, filters, stickers, text, and picture flow. And so on, it provides a better experience for developers.
Developers only need to call the core interface of the SDK to realize various picture edit effects, which greatly improves development efficiency,
reduces costs, and enables their own application products to be quickly launched to the market.
